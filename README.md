# Factors-Influencing-Foreign-Exchange-Rates-Exploring-Relative-Influence-using-Ensemble-Methods
Independent Project (Summer 2018)

To analyze which factors influence changes in foreign exchange rates, most studies have focused extensively
on linear models, assigning variable significance based on standard inferential statistics. However, implicit
assumptions of these models impose structure on the relationship between exchange rates and macroeconomic
forces, often restricting their out-of-sample predictive power. In this paper, I employ ensemble methods
to predict out-of-sample exchange rates of nine different currencies against the U.S. dollar, using both a
regression and classification approach. Input variables constitute monthly frequency macroeconomic data
from different countries over varying periods of time between January 1975 and May 2018. After evaluating
the predictive performance of the models, I compare the relative importance of different macroeconomic
variables in estimating the values. I find that for different currencies, changes in relative consumer price
indices have considerable predictive power, while the predictive power of other macroeconomic variables appear
idiosyncratic to the currency pair.
